# KDecoration2

Plugin based library to create window decorations.

## Introduction

KDecoration2 is a library to create window decorations. These window decorations can be used by
for example an X11 based window manager which re-parents a Client window to a window decoration
frame.

The library consists of two parts:
* Decoration API for implementing a Decoration theme
* Private API to implement the backend part (e.g. from Window Manager side)
